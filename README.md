**Quarter:** Fall/Winter/Spring 2025–26  

---

## 📘 Overview
This project is part of the **Open Project Space (OPS)** year-long embedded systems program at UC Irvine.  
The goal of this project is to learn and apply [key topics — e.g., circuit analysis, microcontroller programming, PWM control, etc.]  
Unlike traditional coursework, OPS focuses on hands-on, project-based learning using real hardware components.
